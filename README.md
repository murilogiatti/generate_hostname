Here's a simple README file for `random_hostname.bat` script:

```markdown
# Set Hostname Script

This script generates a random hostname in the format `LAPTOP/DESKTOP-XXXXXXX` and sets it as the new hostname for the system.

The hostname is composed of a fixed prefix `LAPTOP/DESKTOP-` followed by seven random characters (uppercase letters and digits).

## Usage

1. Download the `random_hostname.bat` file.
2. Open a PowerShell or Terminal with administrative privileges.
3. Navigate to the directory where `random_hostname.bat` is located.
4. Execute the script by typing:
  .\generate_hostname.bat
5. The script will generate a new random hostname and set it for the system. It will also display the new hostname in the command prompt.

## Script Details

The script consists of the following parts:

- Generates a random hostname in the format `LAPTOP/DESKTOP-XXXXXXX`.
- Uses the `wmic` command to set the new hostname.
- The charset used for random generation includes uppercase letters (A-Z) and digits (0-9).

## Note

- The script needs to be run with administrative privileges to change the hostname.
- Ensure to save your work and close all applications before running the script, as changing the hostname might require a restart.

## Example Output

LAPTOP-A1B2C3D
Hostname changed to: LAPTOP-A1B2C3D
